Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The client was The Gaming Room. They were wanting to develop their mobile app into a web based game and needed help with the best way to develop it. They needed something that could show high resolution images with fast speed and with plenty of storage capabilties. Also, needed to have unique games, teams and players. 
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I thought I developed each idea well. I sat down and looked at all the options to determine the best path to take. From there, I developed the best option.
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  Having the design document makes you think more thouroughly about what and why you're designing your code. This is because you have all of these different aspects you think through when doing the document, it gives you different looks at your code.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would revise my development requirements chart. I feel I could of applied it more to the game compared to giving a general idea of how each OS does with the various sides.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  The user's needs were pretty straight forward in what they were looking for. They needed to know the best way to convert their mobile game to a web based game meeting their criteria. It is important to consider the user's needs because you're designing this for them. They are going to be the ones using this and you need to make something quality with what they want.
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  I typically have a pretty methodical approach to developing code. I try to build specific functions needed in the overall code and the build out from there. I develop the main little by little first to test the functions and then finishing by designing it to run the program correctly.
